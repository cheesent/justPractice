#### Future implementations

- [ ] A sprint logo for "justType".
- [ ] Different command-line options, such as, `justType practice`, `justType progress`.
	(Progress is saved on the csv files anyways but a more visual way to watch daily and overall progress without having to pull out the `panda`s)
- [ ] Better score, based more on wpm.
- [ ] Custom pre-made lessons.
